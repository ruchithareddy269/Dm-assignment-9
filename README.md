# Dm-assignment-9-Dimensionality Reduction

## Tasks:

a) PCA, SVD, MDS, ISOMap, LLE

b) UMAP and t-sne

Do proper visualization as well as techniques showcasing selecting the hyperparameter

Use UMAP visualizer and provide screenshots

2) write a colab to illustrate how dimensionality reduction technique like umap can be used followed by clustering. (see slide show in clustering) as well as a classification feature extraction technique
